## 📋 Requirements

- **Root Access**: Device must be rooted
- **LSPosed Framework**: LSPosed v1.8.0+ or compatible Xposed framework
- **Android Version**: Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- **Architecture**: ARM64 or ARM32

## 🔧 Installation

### Step 1: Download and Install
1. Download the latest APK from releases
2. Install the APK: `adb install SimSpoofModule.apk`
3. Or install manually through file manager

### Step 2: LSPosed Configuration
1. Open **LSPosed Manager**
2. Go to **Modules** tab
3. Enable **SIM Spoof Module**
4. Configure scope (see Scope Configuration below)
5. **Reboot** your device

### Step 3: Scope Configuration
The module follows Hide-My-Applist's approach by hooking **ONLY** the System Framework:

**Required Scope:**
- ✅ **System Framework** (`android`) - **ONLY** scope needed

**Why Only System Framework?**
- 🎯 **Universal Coverage**: All app requests go through Android framework
- 🔒 **Better Stealth**: No individual app hooks = harder to detect
- ⚡ **Better Performance**: Single hook point instead of multiple apps
- 🛡️ **Framework-level Protection**: Intercepts calls before they reach apps

**No Individual App Selection Needed!** The system framework hooks automatically protect all apps on your device.

### Step 4: Verification
1. Check LSPosed logs for activation confirmation
2. Use apps that previously detected your environment
3. Monitor logs for interception messages

## ⚙️ Configuration

### SIM Spoofing Values — via Settings screen (recommended)
The module app now has a launcher icon and a **Settings** screen
(`SettingsActivity`). Open the app, edit the fields, tap **Save**, then
reboot the device for the hooks to pick up the new values. Values are
stored in the app's own `SharedPreferences` (`simspoof_prefs`) and read
back at hook time via `XSharedPreferences` — no rebuild required.

If you never open Settings, the module falls back to the built-in
defaults in `SimSpoofDefaults.java` (the same values previously hardcoded
directly in `SimSpoofModule.java`):

```java
ICCID = "89860123456789012345";       // 19-20 digits
IMSI = "310260123456789";             // 15 digits
PHONE_NUMBER = "1234567890";          // used for Line1 number and subscriber number
SUBSCRIBER_NUMBER = "1234567890";
VOICE_MAIL_NUMBER = "123";
COUNTRY_ISO = "US";                   // 2-letter country code, applied to SIM/network ISO too
NETWORK_OPERATOR = "310260";          // MCC+MNC, applied to SIM operator too
OPERATOR_NAME = "T-Mobile";           // applied to SIM operator name too
DEVICE_ID = "123456789012345";        // IMEI (15 digits)
DEVICE_SOFTWARE_VERSION = "01";
GROUP_ID_LEVEL1 = "0";
```

### Common Country/Operator Combinations:

| Country | ISO | MCC+MNC | Operator | Example IMSI |
|---------|-----|---------|----------|--------------|
| United States | US | 310260 | T-Mobile | 310260123456789 |
| United States | US | 310410 | AT&T | 310410123456789 |
| United Kingdom | GB | 23415 | Vodafone | 234151234567890 |
| Germany | DE | 26202 | Vodafone | 262021234567890 |
| France | FR | 20801 | Orange | 208011234567890 |
| Canada | CA | 30272 | Rogers | 302721234567890 |

### Target Apps
**No manual app targeting needed!** The module hooks only the system framework, which automatically covers all apps. Just set the ICCID/IMSI in the Settings screen (see above) and reboot.

### Detection Strings
Customize detection strings to block:

```java
private static final String[] DETECTION_STRINGS = {
    "xposed", "lsposed", "edxposed",
    "custom_detection_string"  // Add custom strings
};
```

## 📱 Scope Configuration Guide

### System Framework (Only Required Scope)
- **Package**: `android`
- **Purpose**: Universal coverage for all apps
- **Why this approach**: 
  - 🎯 **Single point of control**: All API calls go through framework
  - 🔒 **Maximum stealth**: No individual app hooks to detect
  - ⚡ **Best performance**: One hook instead of many
  - 🛡️ **Comprehensive protection**: Covers all apps automatically

### Why Not Individual Apps?
Unlike other modules, this follows Hide-My-Applist's proven approach:
- ❌ **No individual app selection needed**
- ❌ **No performance impact from multiple hooks** 
- ❌ **No detection risk from app-specific hooks**
- ✅ **Universal protection for ALL apps**

## 🔍 How It Works

### SIM Spoofing Mechanism
1. **TelephonyManager Hooks**: Intercepts `getSimSerialNumber()` and `getSubscriberId()`
2. **SubscriptionManager Hooks**: Blocks `getActiveSubscriptionInfoList()`
3. **SubscriptionInfo Hooks**: Replaces `getIccId()` calls
4. **Multi-API Support**: Handles different Android versions

### Anti-Detection Framework
1. **String Interception**: Hooks `String.equals()`, `String.contains()`, `TextUtils.equals()`
2. **File System Hooks**: Intercepts `File.exists()`, `File.listFiles()`, `BufferedReader.readLine()`
3. **Process Filtering**: Filters `Runtime.exec()`, `ProcessBuilder.start()`, process output
4. **System Integration**: Hooks PackageManagerService for app list filtering

### Stealth Techniques
Inspired by Hide-My-Applist methodology:
- **Framework-level hooks** for maximum coverage
- **Selective targeting** for performance optimization  
- **Multi-layer protection** against various detection methods
- **Dynamic filtering** of detection strings and paths

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Module Not Working
- ✅ Verify LSPosed is installed and working
- ✅ Check module is enabled in LSPosed Manager
- ✅ Ensure correct scope configuration (System Framework + Target Apps)
- ✅ Reboot device after enabling
- ✅ Check LSPosed logs for errors

### Apps Still Detecting
- 📝 Add more detection strings to the filter list
- 📝 Verify target app is in the scope
- 📝 Check if app uses native detection methods
- 📝 Consider additional Magisk Hide modules

### Performance Issues
- ⚡ Reduce number of target apps in scope
- ⚡ Disable verbose logging
- ⚡ Check for conflicts with other modules

### Boot Loops
- 🔄 Boot to recovery mode
- 🔄 Disable the module in LSPosed
- 🔄 Check compatibility with your Android version
